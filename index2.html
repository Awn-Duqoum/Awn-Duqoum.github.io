He was engaged in regular company activities, and showed a genuine interest in the lives of those around him.

								Awn reflected on his performance from the last work term and applied a lot of the advice that was provided to him. He clearly performed at a much higher level this term. This was observed by many of his colleagues and he became a voice of authority on certain topics. Awn was asked to assist the design verification team develop testing scripts to accelerate the pace of testing. As he did that, he also became a key figure in finding solutions to the bugs that were identified. Awn worked closely with our senior developers and contributed his ideas and implemented them successfully. Awn also developed an analytics web platform to explore the data which we generate in our manufacturing operations. In the past, a lot of time was spent pulling together historical data to assess our process performance. However, with the new web platform data visualization and analysis occurs much faster. To summarize, Awn has been a value member of the Advanced Research team and has developed a tremendous work ethic. We would like to wish Awn the best of luck in his future endeavours as he pursues other coop opportunities. We do encourage him to contact us when he graduates.

								Awn has impressed me as well as my team with his ability to learn quickly. This was demonstrated with the speed at which he learned the Web Content Accessibility Standard (WCAG) 2.0 as well as his ability to interpret and apply the standard accurately. At times, it was difficult to meet his need for new challenges / tasks. I am especially impressed with his ability to consistently draft verification reports with minimal errors in such a short amount of time. As well, while working with us he has documented our processes, generated a verification guide for new students, generated instructional videos as well as researched new tools which could improve our verification results. Awn is very open minded and responds well to new ideas and suggestions. Regardless of the assigned task, he was always up to the challenge. He will be a great asset to any organization with his consistent performance, professional demeanor and solid interpersonal skills.

				<p class="EngGovExp">The coop term I spent at IJS was unlike any of my previous coop experiences. The term challenged to learn a tremendous about human anatomy, image analysis, metrology, and machine learning. I had the fortunate experience to work on a large variety of projects, the largest being my work with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_shape_model" target='_blank'>Active Shape Models (ASM)</a> to extract key landmarks from X-Ray images to help orthopedic surgeons with preoperative templating and postoperative validation. I was also able to utilize <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_shape_model" target='_blank'>Backpropagation Networks</a> to develop a gesture recognition kernel that allowed surgeons using the Intellijoint Hip product to interact with the system wirelessly.</p>

				<h3 class="JobTitle"> NDI - Northern Digital </h3>
				<p class="EngGovExp">The two CO-OP terms I spent with NDI were the most educational and exciting terms of my university career. I had the fortunate experience of creating a multitude of tools that would aid the research and development process for years to come. Among those tools was a <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/bamboo" target='_blank'> Bamboo </a> build server to automate the testing process of new code releases.  Another tool that was developed was the “Production Data Visualization Toolkit” which helped transform the data collection and visualization process from a tedious undertaking to a trivial effort. While at NDI I got to learn a lot about image processing, data analysis, signal processing and system design.</p>

I learned how to be as effective as possible, doing projects that would a few days in a few hours. I also learned how to document things so that they are readily available whenever they were needed. Leaving my second term with NDI was hard, because I knew no one would ever push me as hard as they did; no one sought perfection as passionately as the advanced research team.</p>
