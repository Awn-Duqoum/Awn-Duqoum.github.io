You will be placed into one of twelve colour groups in an attempt to not only win the coveted title of the week, but to learn more about the University and make lifelong friendships.<br>		<a href="#top">[back to top]</a></p>		<hr>		<p><a id="q2" name="q2"></a><strong>Q.</strong> How can I be a part of Engineering Orientation Week?</p>		<p><strong>A.</strong> Here's a quick summary of the details: <span class="underline">When:</span> Tuesday, September 7, 2010 at 9 AM.<br>		<span class="underline">Where:</span> Engineering Buildings<br>		Please follow the signs directly to your headquarters (or just look at a map)<br>		<span class="underline">What to Wear:</span> It is important to dress appropriately for the weather. During the day, you will be outside having fun in the sun, so wear something comfortable! We would recommend wearing closed toed shoes, comfortable pants or shorts and sunglasses. You will be given a colour group t-shirt at the beginning of the first day. Since there are so many different events as part of Engineering Orientation Week, we cannot guarantee that you won't get wet or dirty!<br>		<span class="underline">What to Bring:</span> Make sure you are always wearing your wrist band.<br>		<span class="underline">What Not to Bring:</span> Electronic devices including cell phones, cameras, mp3 players, your wallet, valuables, your back pack, alcohol and drugs.<br>		<span class="underline">Special Circumstances:</span> Should you have any special circumstances, such as a food allergy or a physical disability, please feel free to contact us at <a href="mailto:foc@engmail.uwaterloo.ca">foc@engmail.uwaterloo.ca</a> and we will do our best to accommodate your needs.<br>		<a href="#top">[back to top]</a></p>		<hr>		<p><a id="q3" name="q3"></a><strong>Q.</strong> How do I get a copy of the Schedule of the week or a description of the Events?</p>		<p><strong>A.</strong> This information is available in the Schedule and Events sections of this web page. You should have also received this in the mail.<br>		<a href="#top">[back to top]</a></p>		<hr>		<p><a id="q4" name="q4"></a><strong>Q.</strong> How do I know what colour group I'm in?</p>		<p><strong>A.</strong> Beginning August 15th, 2010, you can log in from the main page of this website to find out which colour group has selected you. You will need to find your UW ID# from your letter of acceptance to log in. If you are having troubles, please email us at foc@engmail.uwaterloo.ca and we will help you out.<br>		<a href="#top">[back to top]</a></p>		<hr>		<p><a id="q5" name="q5"></a><strong>Q.</strong> What if I want information on my colour group?</p>		<p><strong>A.</strong> Check the Colours section of this website.<br>		<a href="#top">[back to top]</a></p>		<hr>		<p><a id="q6" name="q6"></a><strong>Q.</strong> Do we have to wear the shirts given to us by our colour group all week?</p>		<p><strong>A.</strong> It is expected that you wear your colour group t-shirt at the Engineering only events. This includes Tuesday and Thursday day events and the Friday night event. However, it is encouraged to wear your colour group shirt as much as possible.<br>		<a href="#top">[back to top]</a></p>		<hr>		<p><a id="q7" name="q7"></a><strong>Q.</strong> To whom do I send my questions or concerns?</p>		<p><strong>A.</strong> If you have any questions, you can email your EngFOC at foc@engmail.uwaterloo.ca and we will personally respond to your every question.<br>		<a href="#top">[back to top]</a></p>		<hr>		<p><a id="q8" name="q8"></a><strong>Q.</strong> When do I get my Orientation kit?</p>		<p><strong>A.</strong> You will be receiving your Orientation kit at your headquarters Tuesday morning when you sign in with your colour group.<br>		<a href="#top">[back to top]</a></p>		<hr>		<p><a id="q9" name="q9"></a><strong>Q.</strong> What happens if I get lost?</p>		<p><strong>A.</strong> Find an Orientation leader and they will show you in which direction to go.<br>		<a href="#top">[back to top]</a></p>		<hr>		<p><a id="q10" name="q10"></a><strong>Q.</strong> How do I find my headquarters?</p>		<p><strong>A.</strong> There will be signs posted all over Engineering pointing you in the direction of your colour group headquarters. If you cannot find where to go, ask an Orientation Leader and they will surely help you out.<br>		<a href="#top">[back to top]</a></p>		<hr>		<p><a id="q11" name="q11"></a><strong>Q.</strong> Is attendance mandatory at all the events?</p>		<p><strong>A.</strong> No, it is not (EXCEPT for the ELPE). However, it is highly recommended that you attend as many events as possible. The more you participate, the more fun you'll have; the more friends you'll meet and the more Orientation week will have been a worthwhile experience for you! We hope to see you at all the events!<br>		<a href="#top">[back to top]</a></p>		<hr>		<p><a id="q12" name="q12"></a><strong>Q.</strong> I noticed that one day we have the ELPE scheduled - what is that?</p>		<p>&nbsp;</p>		<p><strong>A.</strong> The ELPE is the English Language Proficiency Exam. This is not something to stress about. It is simply designed to assess your written English skills. Although you are required to either pass the ELPE or to take an English credit, it is not recommended that you study for this exam. The results of this test will not count against any student.</p>		<p>Another exam you will be taking is the Math Preparedness Test during your first week of school. The location and contents of this exam will be discussed during your first calculus lecture of the term (it tests some basic math skills that you probably already possess if you got this far). Don't study for this one either - the "worst" thing that can happen if you do poorly on this exam is that you'll be invited to attend free tutoring sessions - if you need to study to pass it, you may as well get the extra help!<br>		<a href="#top">[back to top]</a></p>		<hr>		<p><a id="q13" name="q13"></a><strong>Q.</strong> Are we allowed to bring marijuana to Orientation Week?</p>		<p>&nbsp;</p>		<p><strong>A.</strong> Officially, marijuana has not been decriminalized and UW is still enforcing a zero tolerance policy for both possession and use. Thus our message at the current time is the same as always. UW enforces a zero tolerance policy for drug use and possession.</p>		<p style="margin-bottom:0px;">Please be warned that the University also enforces a strict underage drinking policy: if you're caught drinking underage in any establishment on campus, you will be banned from all establishments on campus and your access will be suspended until one year after your 19th birthday.<br>		<a href="#top">[back to top]</a></p><!-- InstanceEndEditable -->	</div></div><div class="nav-bottom center">	<a href="welcome.html">welcome</a> | <a href="schedule.html">schedule</a> | <a href="colours.html">colours</a> | <a href="hardhats.html">hardhats</a> | <a href="history.html">history</a> | <a href="faqs.html">faqs</a> | <a href="links.html">links</a> | <a href="sponsors.html">sponsors</a></div><!-- InstanceEnd --></html>
