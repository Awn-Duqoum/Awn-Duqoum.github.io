					<h3 class="text-center"> Unity</h3>
					<p> My biggest campaign promise and one of my main focuses will be to actively work toward removing the stigma around engineering isolation. Currently engineering is viewed as the most isolated faculty, this was very evident to me during my time with Feds. If elected I would work my hardest at repairing the Engsoc’s relationship with Feds and building new bridges with all other faculties, clubs and services. I dream of an Engsoc that is friends with everyone on campus and is approached every term with collaboration ideas.  </p>

                    <img src="img/PushPush.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="">
					<br>
					<h3 class="text-center"> Traditions and Spirit</h3>
					<p> Engsoc has a long history of traditions which I would work toward maintaining and evolving. To do this I would work toward creating a place on campus in which our traditions can be displayed for future generations. </p>
					<p> Promoting school/faculty spirit and pride is matter that is very dear to me. If elected I would work with the newly formed “Warrior Tribe” to hold events to promote spirt. To promote pride, I would work with the departments and class representatives to create program specific murals.  </p>

                    <img src="img/SarbIsBae.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="">
					<br>
					<h3 class="text-center"> Internal Changes  </h3>
					<p>During my time as commissioner, director and feds volunteer there was always a common theme of under-appreciation. Many of the individuals I had the privilege to work with rarely got the recognition they deserved for all their hard work. If elected I would ensure that every director, commissioner, officer and VP feels appreciated and valued. Furthermore, I would work toward making Engsoc an environment where appreciation is the norm and no hard work goes unrecognised which in turn would lead to an Engsoc where getting involved is a much more rewarding experience.</p>

					<br>
					<h3 class="text-center"> Mental Health Awareness (MHA)</h3>
					<p> Many of Engsoc’s previous and current presidents have done amazing work promoting MHA efforts in the society, if elected I would continue to support these efforts. I would work with the faculty and university to lower waiting times for appointments and develop other methods for students to receive the support they need. I would also integrate the current mental health blog into the Engsoc website and create a digital copy of POETS secret week so that students who do not feel comfortable enough approaching the directors can still have their stories told.</p>

					<br>
					<h3 class="text-center"> Community Involvement</h3>
					<p> As president I would work to improve the society's involvement with both the university community and the Waterloo community. Volunteering has been a big part of my life, I’ve learned a lot of what I know now by volunteering and I would like to make the process of finding a way to get involved easier for all Engsoc members. Also to further extend my promise of unity I would work with FEDS’s volunteer center to make my goal of community involvement a reality.</p>

					<br>
					<h3 class="text-center"> Representation and Transparency </h3>
					<p> I consider Engsoc to be my family, and a family is supposed to know what it’s members need and what they are up too. If elected, I would work hard to improve executive transparency and the transparency of the society as a whole. I would also work on improving representation so that each and every member knows that their voice is both important and heard. I dream of a day where any engineering student can walk into the orifice or POETS and feel at home. </p>

				<p class="EngGovExp">While at Waterloo I represented my class as a WEEF rep every term since 1A. I was Student Life Commissioner in Winter 2016 in which I became very familiar with the internal portfolio, and learned a lot about student interest and how to better structure events and event planning. During JAGM (Joint Annual General Meeting) 2016 I was voted in as a member of the Board of Directors, lastly for Fall 2016 I will be one of the Mental Health and Bus Push Directors .</p>
				<br>
                <p class="FedsExp">Outside of my beloved EngSoc I have also been active. I have been a Don with OCC (The Off Campus Community) every term since spring 2015 and also helped run RAK (The Random Acts of Kindness Club) as their marketing executive. I also served as a sub-team lead for the BioMechatronics design team, by running the Enable team. Lastly, I have been a member of Velocity as a volunteer for Qidni Labs Inc. </p>
